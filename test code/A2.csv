<div><h3><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://blog.paessler.com/opinions-from-our-cto-about-deepfake-industrial-it-and-the-coronavirus-crisis"">What&#39;s up, Steve? – opinions from our CTO about deepfake, Industrial IT, and the coronavirus crisis</a></h3><p>2020 is over but this awful year will haunt us anyway. First, there was the turbulent U.S. election, whose entanglement with pernicious technological possibilities was long debated. In the end, there was not the feared flood of deepfake news, but this should not lead us to believe that we are off the hook. And then, needless to say, there was the ubiquitous topic of the coronavirus pandemic, which, leaving aside the almost 2,5 million global deaths to date, has presented challenges, some of them existential, to just about every industry around the globe. In the wake of the crisis, we at Paessler have switched to completely new working models that will remain valid even in a corona-free future. And there is another piece of news: We at Paessler have made a quantum leap towards new solutions for different industries in 2020. It is clear to us that the manufacturing industry is losing out on a lot of potential with existing processes: convergence of IT and OT (operational technology) flows is the decisive key term here. In our weekly newsletter &quot;What&#39;s up tech world? (which I strongly recommend you to subscribe to, because many subscribers make me very happy), Steve has his own regular opinion column called &quot;What&#39;s up, Steve?&quot; Below are the first three parts, published in late 2020.</p></div>
<div><h3><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://blog.paessler.com/new-handling-of-beta-sensors-in-prtg-network-monitor"">New handling of beta sensors in PRTG Network Monitor</a></h3><p>In the blog article about PRTG release 21.1.65, I promised to tell you more about the experimental features in PRTG. The introduction of experimental features is accompanied by a new handling of beta sensors. Let’s have a look at exactly what this means, and what has changed.</p></div>
<div><h3><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://blog.paessler.com/useful-command-line-parameters-for-prtg-setup"">Useful command line parameters for PRTG setup</a></h3><p>Our goal at Paessler is to provide you with a straightforward installation process. All you need is to download and run the latest PRTG installer (309 MB) from our website, add your email address and license information and enjoy your coffee while PRTG gets to work. PRTG will run an initial auto-discovery as soon as the installation of PRTG is finished. It will automatically add devices that are able to respond to ICMP in your network as well as suitable sensors for monitoring.</p></div>
<div><h3><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://blog.paessler.com/prtg-21.1.65-contains-beta-sensors-for-hpe-azure-veeam-and-opc-ua"">PRTG 21.1.65 contains beta sensors for HPE, Azure, Veeam and OPC UA</a></h3><p>The first stable release of 2021 for PRTG Network Monitor is here! By the way: PRTG release 21.1.65 is the 8th version in a row that our developers have programmed completely while working from home.</p></div>
<div><h3><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://blog.paessler.com/modular-or-all-in-one-two-different-approaches-in-it-monitoring"">Modular or all-in-one? Two different approaches in IT monitoring</a></h3><p>The larger networks become, the more important it is to have an overview. IT decision-makers and IT administrators are faced with the question: &quot;What is the right solution for my infrastructure?&quot; This question cannot be answered in one sentence, because many factors play an important role. First, it should be considered which information a monitoring solution must provide and how high the level of detail should be.</p></div>
<div><h3><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://blog.paessler.com/6-challenges-for-industrial-it-over-the-next-five-years"">6 Challenges for Industrial IT over the next five years</a></h3><p>Industrial IT has seen many changes over the past decade, with IT/OT convergence, Industry 4.0, and increased digitization all shaping the way the production floor connects and interacts with IT. And while we’ve already seen a lot of transformation in the industrial sphere, it’s also clear that it’s not stopping any time soon: By 2025, the IIoT market will be worth $110.6 billion, and this will only further drive the digitization trends we’ve seen so far.</p></div>
<div><h3><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://blog.paessler.com/rhebo-industrial-protector-and-prtg"">Rhebo Industrial Protector – keeping the lights on</a></h3><p>Industroyer, NotPetya, EKANS, Triton, LockerGoga. If those five words just sent a chill down your spine, chances are you work in the industrial control sector. For decades the OT world relied on “security through obscurity” to guarantee its safety – it’s difficult to attack a network that you can’t connect to. Unfortunately, for most companies, completely isolating their ICS environments from the outside world is no longer an option. Increased need for IT/OT convergence, remote access support demands from equipment vendors, and the need to collect, analyze&amp;nbsp;and store sensor data from IIoT applications all mean that industrial networks are increasingly connected to the outside world. Therefore, they are vulnerable to attack.</p></div>
<div><h3><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://blog.paessler.com/would-you-like-to-monitor-linux-with-prtg"">Would you like to expand your PRTG Linux monitoring?</a></h3><p>Ok, now that we have your attention… We are not kidding!</p></div>
<div><h3><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://blog.paessler.com/measurements-of-co2-and-other-values-in-schools"">Measurement of CO₂ and other values in schools – why we should approach this task during and after the pandemic</a></h3><p>If you are anything like me, you probably remember the smell of your old school building. As I write these lines, I have the distinct scent of my school&#39;s gym mats in my nose, as clearly as if I’m right now facing the terrible task of performing some stupid gymnastic exercise. The same goes for my former classroom: it was somehow musty, stale, steamy. And there was a reason for that: the air was fabulously bad. We know today that an excessively high proportion of CO₂ in the air can have disastrous consequences for concentration and that the levels become critical much earlier than instinctively suspected – depending on how many people are in a room, how old they are, how large their lung capacity is, and other factors. An already degraded air quality starts at 1,000 to about 1,400 ppm CO₂ in indoor air – we know that this value is often exceeded many times over in classrooms, even values of 2,000 up to 5,000 ppm can occur. This poses a risk, in the winter of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic as well as during normal school operation.</p></div>
<div><h3><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://blog.paessler.com/storage-performance-monitoring-with-prtg"">Storage performance monitoring with PRTG</a></h3><p>Storage performance monitoring should be a standard part of every intelligent monitoring solution as it can have a major, positive impact on daily business. Find out why PRTG Network Monitor is the ideal solution for storage performance monitoring below.</p></div>
<div><h3><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://blog.paessler.com/get-certified-with-paessler-become-a-prtg-monitoring-expert"">Get Certified with Paessler: Become a PRTG Monitoring Expert!</a></h3><p>Have you heard about Paessler Certified Monitoring Expert? It is a technical certification that goes hand in hand with our technical PRTG training. Our focus through our training and certification program is to empower and give our partners and customers enough knowledge to properly plan, demonstrate, install and to provide first-level support. Also, as a Monitoring Expert you can help your customers to choose the best license for certain architecture and sensor strategy design.</p></div>
<div><h3><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://blog.paessler.com/get-alerted-on-physical-server-health-state-via-idrac-ilo-irmc-and-ipmi"">Track the health status of physical servers via iDRAC, iLO, iRMC and IMM</a></h3><p>We at Paessler are running heterogeneous network infrastructure powered by different physical servers such as Dell PowerEdge, HPE ProLiant, Fujitsu Primergy and IBM xSystem. Some of them are running as standalone servers and some are part of the cluster. One of the things I very much appreciate about managing my servers is the possibility to do it remotely, without even going to the server room and getting frozen, especially during the winter season. The remote management (hardware configuration, firmware upgrade or OS upgrade) can easily be done via management platforms/controllers/ports: iDRAC, iLO, iRMC and IMM – depending on the vendor.</p></div>
<div><h3><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://blog.paessler.com/prtg-network-monitor-in-2020-a-review"">This was 2020 with PRTG. A review.</a></h3><p>Wow. 2020 was quite a hell ride for all of us! And I don&#39;t just mean us at Paessler, but really all of us. The whole planet experienced a rather exceptional year!</p></div>
<div><h3><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://blog.paessler.com/what-weve-learned-in-one-year-after-installing-a-pv-system-on-our-roof"">You wouldn&#39;t believe what we&#39;ve learned in one year after installing a PV system on our roof</a></h3><p>So, what happened to the photovoltaic system on our company roof? In short: It is still there. In a little longer: We couldn&#39;t be happier that we as a company are reducing our footprint on this earth by generating a significant portion of the electricity we use. We have been tracking our photovoltaic system, its output and our specific consumption for over a year now, and would like to give you a brief overview of our many insights.</p></div>
<div><h3><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://blog.paessler.com/we-released-version-20.3.0-of-our-prtg-ios-and-android-app"">We released version 20.3.0 of our PRTG iOS and Android App</a></h3><p>I regularly tell you here about the changes in the PRTG versions and the new sensors and features the software provides.</p></div>

                This is the default welcome page used to test the correct 
                operation of the Apache2 server after installation on Ubuntu systems.
                It is based on the equivalent page on Debian, from which the Ubuntu Apache
                packaging is derived.
                If you can read this page, it means that the Apache HTTP server installed at
                this site is working properly. You should <b>replace this file</b> (located at
                <tt>/var/www/html/index.html</tt>) before continuing to operate your HTTP server.

                Configuration Overview
        </div>
        <div class=""content_section_text"">
          <p>
                Ubuntu's Apache2 default configuration is different from the
                upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for
                interaction with Ubuntu tools. The configuration system is
                <b>fully documented in
                /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz</b>. Refer to this for the full
                documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be
                found by accessing the <a href=""/manual"">manual</a> if the <tt>apache2-doc</tt>
                package was installed on this server.

          </p>
          <p>
                The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Ubuntu systems is as follows:
          </p>
          <pre>
/etc/apache2/
|-- apache2.conf
|       `--  ports.conf

                           <tt>apache2.conf</tt> is the main configuration
                           file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration
                           files when starting up the web server.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                           <tt>ports.conf</tt> is always included from the
                           main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for
                           incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime.
