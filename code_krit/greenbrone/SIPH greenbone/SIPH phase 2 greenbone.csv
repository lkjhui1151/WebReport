  strength:

  - RC4 is considered to be weak (CVE-2013-2566, CVE-2015-2808)

  - Ciphers using 64 bit or less are considered to be vulnerable to brute force methods
  and therefore considered as weak (CVE-2015-4000)

  - 1024 bit RSA authentication is considered to be insecure and therefore as weak

  - Any cipher considered to be secure for only the next 10 years is considered as medium

  - Any other cipher is considered as strong","
