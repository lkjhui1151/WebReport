  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,

    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial

need to be done again.","- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,

    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial

need to be done again.","- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

unresponsive.

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop
    running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may
need to be done again.","- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

- Disable any IPS during the Nessus scan","","Port 443 was detected as being open initially but was found unresponsive later.
