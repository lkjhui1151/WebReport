An attacker can supply crafted input to break out of the data context in which their input appears and interfere with the structure of the surrounding query.</p>\n<p>A wide range of damaging attacks can often be delivered via SQL injection, including reading or modifying critical application data, interfering with application logic, escalating privileges within the database and taking control of the database server. </p>","<p>The most effective way to prevent SQL injection attacks is to use parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements) for all database access. This method uses two steps to incorporate potentially tainted data into SQL queries: first, the application specifies the structure of the query, leaving placeholders for each item of user input; second, the application specifies the contents of each placeholder. Because the structure of the query has already been defined in the first step, it is not possible for malformed data in the second step to interfere with the query structure. You should review the documentation for your database and application platform to determine the appropriate APIs which you can use to perform parameterized queries. It is strongly recommended that you parameterize <i>every</i> variable data item that is incorporated into database queries, even if it is not obviously tainted, to prevent oversights occurring and avoid vulnerabilities being introduced by changes elsewhere within the code base of the application.</p>\n<p>You should be aware that some commonly employed and recommended mitigations for SQL injection vulnerabilities are not always effective: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>One common defense is to double up any single quotation marks appearing within user input before incorporating that input into a SQL query. This defense is designed to prevent malformed data from terminating the string into which it is inserted. However, if the data being incorporated into queries is numeric, then the defense may fail, because numeric data may not be encapsulated within quotes, in which case only a space is required to break out of the data context and interfere with the query. Further, in second-order SQL injection attacks, data that has been safely escaped when initially inserted into the database is subsequently read from the database and then passed back to it again. Quotation marks that have been doubled up initially will return to their original form when the data is reused, allowing the defense to be bypassed.</li>\n  <li>Another often cited defense is to use stored procedures for database access. While stored procedures can provide security benefits, they are not guaranteed to prevent SQL injection attacks. The same kinds of vulnerabilities that arise within standard dynamic SQL queries can arise if any SQL is dynamically constructed within stored procedures. Further, even if the procedure is sound, SQL injection can arise if the procedure is invoked in an unsafe manner using user-controllable data.</li>\n</ul>","<ul>\n<li><a href=""https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection"">Web Security Academy: SQL injection</a></li>\n<li><a href=""https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1965677-using-burp-to-test-for-injection-flaws"">Using Burp to Test for Injection Flaws</a></li>\n<li><a href=""https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/cheat-sheet"">Web Security Academy: SQL Injection Cheat Sheet</a></li>\n</ul>","<ul>\n<li><a href=""https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html"">CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')</a></li>\n<li><a href=""https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html"">CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')</a></li>\n<li><a href=""https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html"">CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output</a></li>\n  <li><a href=""https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/66.html"">CAPEC-66: SQL Injection</a></li>\n</ul>","The <b>username</b> parameter appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

Because browsers automatically add cookies to requests regardless of their origin, it may be possible for an attacker to create a malicious web site that forges a cross-domain request to the vulnerable application. For a request to be vulnerable to CSRF, the following conditions must hold:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The request can be issued cross-domain, for example using an HTML form. If the request contains non-standard headers or body content, then it may only be issuable from a page that originated on the same domain.</li>\n<li>The application relies solely on HTTP cookies or Basic Authentication to identify the user that issued the request. If the application places session-related tokens elsewhere within the request, then it may not be vulnerable.</li>\n<li>The request performs some privileged action within the application, which modifies the application's state based on the identity of the issuing user.</li><li>The attacker can determine all the parameters required to construct a request that performs the action. If the request contains any values that the attacker cannot determine or predict, then it is not vulnerable.</li></ul>","<p>The most effective way to protect against CSRF vulnerabilities is to include within relevant requests an additional token that is not transmitted in a cookie: for example, a parameter in a hidden form field. This additional token should contain sufficient entropy, and be generated using a cryptographic random number generator, such that it is not feasible for an attacker to determine or predict the value of any token that was issued to another user. The token should be associated with the user's session, and the application should validate that the correct token is received before performing any action resulting from the request.</p>\n<p>An alternative approach, which may be easier to implement, is to validate that Host and Referer headers in relevant requests are both present and contain the same domain name. However, this approach is somewhat less robust: historically, quirks in browsers and plugins have often enabled attackers to forge cross-domain requests that manipulate these headers to bypass such defenses. </p>","<ul>\n    <li><a href=""https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf"">Web Security Academy: Cross-site request forgery</a></li>\n    <li><a href=""https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1965674-using-burp-to-test-for-cross-site-request-forgery-csrf-"">Using Burp to Test for Cross-Site Request Forgery</a></li>\n    <li><a href=""https://media.blackhat.com/eu-13/briefings/Lundeen/bh-eu-13-deputies-still-confused-lundeen-wp.pdf"">The Deputies Are Still Confused</a></li>\n</ul>","<ul>\n<li><a href=""https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html"">CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</a></li>\n    <li><a href=""https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/62.html"">CAPEC-62: Cross Site Request Forgery</a></li>\n</ul>",The request appears to be vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks against authenticated users.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An attacker can supply crafted input to break out of the data context in which their input appears and interfere with the structure of the surrounding query.</p>\n<p>A wide range of damaging attacks can often be delivered via SQL injection, including reading or modifying critical application data, interfering with application logic, escalating privileges within the database and taking control of the database server. </p>","<p>The most effective way to prevent SQL injection attacks is to use parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements) for all database access. This method uses two steps to incorporate potentially tainted data into SQL queries: first, the application specifies the structure of the query, leaving placeholders for each item of user input; second, the application specifies the contents of each placeholder. Because the structure of the query has already been defined in the first step, it is not possible for malformed data in the second step to interfere with the query structure. You should review the documentation for your database and application platform to determine the appropriate APIs which you can use to perform parameterized queries. It is strongly recommended that you parameterize <i>every</i> variable data item that is incorporated into database queries, even if it is not obviously tainted, to prevent oversights occurring and avoid vulnerabilities being introduced by changes elsewhere within the code base of the application.</p>\n<p>You should be aware that some commonly employed and recommended mitigations for SQL injection vulnerabilities are not always effective: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>One common defense is to double up any single quotation marks appearing within user input before incorporating that input into a SQL query. This defense is designed to prevent malformed data from terminating the string into which it is inserted. However, if the data being incorporated into queries is numeric, then the defense may fail, because numeric data may not be encapsulated within quotes, in which case only a space is required to break out of the data context and interfere with the query. Further, in second-order SQL injection attacks, data that has been safely escaped when initially inserted into the database is subsequently read from the database and then passed back to it again. Quotation marks that have been doubled up initially will return to their original form when the data is reused, allowing the defense to be bypassed.</li>\n  <li>Another often cited defense is to use stored procedures for database access. While stored procedures can provide security benefits, they are not guaranteed to prevent SQL injection attacks. The same kinds of vulnerabilities that arise within standard dynamic SQL queries can arise if any SQL is dynamically constructed within stored procedures.

An attacker can supply crafted input to break out of the data context in which their input appears and interfere with the structure of the surrounding query.</p>\n<p>A wide range of damaging attacks can often be delivered via SQL injection, including reading or modifying critical application data, interfering with application logic, escalating privileges within the database and taking control of the database server. </p>","<p>The most effective way to prevent SQL injection attacks is to use parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements) for all database access. This method uses two steps to incorporate potentially tainted data into SQL queries: first, the application specifies the structure of the query, leaving placeholders for each item of user input; second, the application specifies the contents of each placeholder. Because the structure of the query has already been defined in the first step, it is not possible for malformed data in the second step to interfere with the query structure. You should review the documentation for your database and application platform to determine the appropriate APIs which you can use to perform parameterized queries. It is strongly recommended that you parameterize <i>every</i> variable data item that is incorporated into database queries, even if it is not obviously tainted, to prevent oversights occurring and avoid vulnerabilities being introduced by changes elsewhere within the code base of the application.</p>\n<p>You should be aware that some commonly employed and recommended mitigations for SQL injection vulnerabilities are not always effective: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>One common defense is to double up any single quotation marks appearing within user input before incorporating that input into a SQL query. This defense is designed to prevent malformed data from terminating the string into which it is inserted. However, if the data being incorporated into queries is numeric, then the defense may fail, because numeric data may not be encapsulated within quotes, in which case only a space is required to break out of the data context and interfere with the query. Further, in second-order SQL injection attacks, data that has been safely escaped when initially inserted into the database is subsequently read from the database and then passed back to it again. Quotation marks that have been doubled up initially will return to their original form when the data is reused, allowing the defense to be bypassed.</li>\n  <li>Another often cited defense is to use stored procedures for database access. While stored procedures can provide security benefits, they are not guaranteed to prevent SQL injection attacks. The same kinds of vulnerabilities that arise within standard dynamic SQL queries can arise if any SQL is dynamically constructed within stored procedures. Further, even if the procedure is sound, SQL injection can arise if the procedure is invoked in an unsafe manner using user-controllable data.</li>\n</ul>","<ul>\n<li><a href=""https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection"">Web Security Academy: SQL injection</a></li>\n<li><a href=""https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1965677-using-burp-to-test-for-injection-flaws"">Using Burp to Test for Injection Flaws</a></li>\n<li><a href=""https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/cheat-sheet"">Web Security Academy: SQL Injection Cheat Sheet</a></li>\n</ul>","<ul>\n<li><a href=""https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html"">CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')</a></li>\n<li><a href=""https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html"">CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')</a></li>\n<li><a href=""https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html"">CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output</a></li>\n  <li><a href=""https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/66.html"">CAPEC-66: SQL Injection</a></li>\n</ul>","The <b>id</b> parameter appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

Because browsers automatically add cookies to requests regardless of their origin, it may be possible for an attacker to create a malicious web site that forges a cross-domain request to the vulnerable application. For a request to be vulnerable to CSRF, the following conditions must hold:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The request can be issued cross-domain, for example using an HTML form. If the request contains non-standard headers or body content, then it may only be issuable from a page that originated on the same domain.</li>\n<li>The application relies solely on HTTP cookies or Basic Authentication to identify the user that issued the request. If the application places session-related tokens elsewhere within the request, then it may not be vulnerable.</li>\n<li>The request performs some privileged action within the application, which modifies the application's state based on the identity of the issuing user.</li><li>The attacker can determine all the parameters required to construct a request that performs the action. If the request contains any values that the attacker cannot determine or predict, then it is not vulnerable.</li></ul>","<p>The most effective way to protect against CSRF vulnerabilities is to include within relevant requests an additional token that is not transmitted in a cookie: for example, a parameter in a hidden form field. This additional token should contain sufficient entropy, and be generated using a cryptographic random number generator, such that it is not feasible for an attacker to determine or predict the value of any token that was issued to another user. The token should be associated with the user's session, and the application should validate that the correct token is received before performing any action resulting from the request.</p>\n<p>An alternative approach, which may be easier to implement, is to validate that Host and Referer headers in relevant requests are both present and contain the same domain name. However, this approach is somewhat less robust: historically, quirks in browsers and plugins have often enabled attackers to forge cross-domain requests that manipulate these headers to bypass such defenses. </p>","<ul>\n    <li><a href=""https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf"">Web Security Academy: Cross-site request forgery</a></li>\n    <li><a href=""https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1965674-using-burp-to-test-for-cross-site-request-forgery-csrf-"">Using Burp to Test for Cross-Site Request Forgery</a></li>\n    <li><a href=""https://media.blackhat.com/eu-13/briefings/Lundeen/bh-eu-13-deputies-still-confused-lundeen-wp.pdf"">The Deputies Are Still Confused</a></li>\n</ul>","<ul>\n<li><a href=""https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html"">CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</a></li>\n    <li><a href=""https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/62.html"">CAPEC-62: Cross Site Request Forgery</a></li>\n</ul>",The request appears to be vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks against authenticated users.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An attacker can use the vulnerability to construct a request that, if issued by another application user, will cause JavaScript code supplied by the attacker to execute within the user's browser in the context of that user's session with the application.</p>\n<p>The attacker-supplied code can perform a wide variety of actions, such as stealing the victim's session token or login credentials, performing arbitrary actions on the victim's behalf, and logging their keystrokes.</p>\n<p>Users can be induced to issue the attacker's crafted request in various ways. For example, the attacker can send a victim a link containing a malicious URL in an email or instant message. They can submit the link to popular web sites that allow content authoring, for example in blog comments. And they can create an innocuous looking web site that causes anyone viewing it to make arbitrary cross-domain requests to the vulnerable application (using either the GET or the POST method).</p>\n<p>The security impact of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities is dependent upon the nature of the vulnerable application, the kinds of data and functionality that it contains, and the other applications that belong to the same domain and organization. If the application is used only to display non-sensitive public content, with no authentication or access control functionality, then a cross-site scripting flaw may be considered low risk. However, if the same application resides on a domain that can access cookies for other more security-critical applications, then the vulnerability could be used to attack those other applications, and so may be considered high risk. Similarly, if the organization that owns the application is a likely target for phishing attacks, then the vulnerability could be leveraged to lend credibility to such attacks, by injecting Trojan functionality into the vulnerable application and exploiting users' trust in the organization in order to capture credentials for other applications that it owns. In many kinds of application, such as those providing online banking functionality, cross-site scripting should always be considered high risk. </p>","<p>In most situations where user-controllable data is copied into application responses, cross-site scripting \n  attacks can be prevented using two layers of defenses:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Input should be validated as strictly as possible on arrival, given the kind of content that \nit is expected to contain. For example, personal names should consist of alphabetical \nand a small range of typographical characters, and be relatively short; a year of birth \nshould consist of exactly four numerals; email addresses should match a well-defined \nregular expression. Input which fails the validation should be rejected, not sanitized.</li>\n<li>User input should be HTML-encoded at any point where it is copied into \napplication responses. All HTML metacharacters, including &lt; &gt; "" ' and =, should be \nreplaced with the corresponding HTML entities (&amp;lt; &amp;gt; etc).</li></ul>\n<p>In cases where the application's functionality allows users to author content using \n  a restricted subset of HTML tags and attributes (for example, blog comments which \n  allow limited formatting and linking), it is necessary to parse the supplied HTML to \n  validate that it does not use any dangerous syntax; this is a non-trivial task.</p>","<ul>\n	<li><a href=""https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting"">Web Security Academy: Cross-site scripting</a></li>\n	<li><a href=""https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/reflected"">Web Security Academy: Reflected cross-site scripting</a></li>\n	<li><a href=""https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1965737-Methodology_XSS.html"">Using Burp to Find XSS issues</a></li>\n</ul>","<ul>\n<li><a href=""https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html"">CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')</a></li>\n<li><a href=""https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/80.html"">CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)</a></li>\n<li><a href=""https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html"">CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output</a></li>\n<li><a href=""https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/159.html"">CWE-159: Failure to Sanitize Special Element</a></li>\n    <li><a href=""https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/591.html"">CAPEC-591: Reflected XSS</a></li>\n</ul>",The value of the <b>include</b> request parameter is copied into the value of an HTML tag attribute which is encapsulated in single quotation marks.

However, if the same application resides on a domain that can access cookies for other more security-critical applications, then the vulnerability could be used to attack those other applications, and so may be considered high risk. Similarly, if the organization that owns the application is a likely target for phishing attacks, then the vulnerability could be leveraged to lend credibility to such attacks, by injecting Trojan functionality into the vulnerable application and exploiting users' trust in the organization in order to capture credentials for other applications that it owns.

Because browsers automatically add cookies to requests regardless of their origin, it may be possible for an attacker to create a malicious web site that forges a cross-domain request to the vulnerable application. For a request to be vulnerable to CSRF, the following conditions must hold:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The request can be issued cross-domain, for example using an HTML form. If the request contains non-standard headers or body content, then it may only be issuable from a page that originated on the same domain.</li>\n<li>The application relies solely on HTTP cookies or Basic Authentication to identify the user that issued the request. If the application places session-related tokens elsewhere within the request, then it may not be vulnerable.</li>\n<li>The request performs some privileged action within the application, which modifies the application's state based on the identity of the issuing user.</li><li>The attacker can determine all the parameters required to construct a request that performs the action. If the request contains any values that the attacker cannot determine or predict, then it is not vulnerable.</li></ul>","<p>The most effective way to protect against CSRF vulnerabilities is to include within relevant requests an additional token that is not transmitted in a cookie: for example, a parameter in a hidden form field. This additional token should contain sufficient entropy, and be generated using a cryptographic random number generator, such that it is not feasible for an attacker to determine or predict the value of any token that was issued to another user. The token should be associated with the user's session, and the application should validate that the correct token is received before performing any action resulting from the request.</p>\n<p>An alternative approach, which may be easier to implement, is to validate that Host and Referer headers in relevant requests are both present and contain the same domain name. However, this approach is somewhat less robust: historically, quirks in browsers and plugins have often enabled attackers to forge cross-domain requests that manipulate these headers to bypass such defenses. </p>","<ul>\n    <li><a href=""https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf"">Web Security Academy: Cross-site request forgery</a></li>\n    <li><a href=""https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1965674-using-burp-to-test-for-cross-site-request-forgery-csrf-"">Using Burp to Test for Cross-Site Request Forgery</a></li>\n    <li><a href=""https://media.blackhat.com/eu-13/briefings/Lundeen/bh-eu-13-deputies-still-confused-lundeen-wp.pdf"">The Deputies Are Still Confused</a></li>\n</ul>","<ul>\n<li><a href=""https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html"">CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</a></li>\n    <li><a href=""https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/62.html"">CAPEC-62: Cross Site Request Forgery</a></li>\n</ul>",The request appears to be vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks against authenticated users.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An attacker can use the vulnerability to construct a request that, if issued by another application user, will cause JavaScript code supplied by the attacker to execute within the user's browser in the context of that user's session with the application.</p>\n<p>The attacker-supplied code can perform a wide variety of actions, such as stealing the victim's session token or login credentials, performing arbitrary actions on the victim's behalf, and logging their keystrokes.</p>\n<p>Users can be induced to issue the attacker's crafted request in various ways. For example, the attacker can send a victim a link containing a malicious URL in an email or instant message. They can submit the link to popular web sites that allow content authoring, for example in blog comments. And they can create an innocuous looking web site that causes anyone viewing it to make arbitrary cross-domain requests to the vulnerable application (using either the GET or the POST method).</p>\n<p>The security impact of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities is dependent upon the nature of the vulnerable application, the kinds of data and functionality that it contains, and the other applications that belong to the same domain and organization. If the application is used only to display non-sensitive public content, with no authentication or access control functionality, then a cross-site scripting flaw may be considered low risk. However, if the same application resides on a domain that can access cookies for other more security-critical applications, then the vulnerability could be used to attack those other applications, and so may be considered high risk. Similarly, if the organization that owns the application is a likely target for phishing attacks, then the vulnerability could be leveraged to lend credibility to such attacks, by injecting Trojan functionality into the vulnerable application and exploiting users' trust in the organization in order to capture credentials for other applications that it owns. In many kinds of application, such as those providing online banking functionality, cross-site scripting should always be considered high risk. </p>","<p>In most situations where user-controllable data is copied into application responses, cross-site scripting \n  attacks can be prevented using two layers of defenses:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Input should be validated as strictly as possible on arrival, given the kind of content that \nit is expected to contain.

Because browsers automatically add cookies to requests regardless of their origin, it may be possible for an attacker to create a malicious web site that forges a cross-domain request to the vulnerable application. For a request to be vulnerable to CSRF, the following conditions must hold:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The request can be issued cross-domain, for example using an HTML form. If the request contains non-standard headers or body content, then it may only be issuable from a page that originated on the same domain.</li>\n<li>The application relies solely on HTTP cookies or Basic Authentication to identify the user that issued the request. If the application places session-related tokens elsewhere within the request, then it may not be vulnerable.</li>\n<li>The request performs some privileged action within the application, which modifies the application's state based on the identity of the issuing user.</li><li>The attacker can determine all the parameters required to construct a request that performs the action. If the request contains any values that the attacker cannot determine or predict, then it is not vulnerable.</li></ul>","<p>The most effective way to protect against CSRF vulnerabilities is to include within relevant requests an additional token that is not transmitted in a cookie: for example, a parameter in a hidden form field. This additional token should contain sufficient entropy, and be generated using a cryptographic random number generator, such that it is not feasible for an attacker to determine or predict the value of any token that was issued to another user. The token should be associated with the user's session, and the application should validate that the correct token is received before performing any action resulting from the request.</p>\n<p>An alternative approach, which may be easier to implement, is to validate that Host and Referer headers in relevant requests are both present and contain the same domain name. However, this approach is somewhat less robust: historically, quirks in browsers and plugins have often enabled attackers to forge cross-domain requests that manipulate these headers to bypass such defenses. </p>","<ul>\n    <li><a href=""https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf"">Web Security Academy: Cross-site request forgery</a></li>\n    <li><a href=""https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1965674-using-burp-to-test-for-cross-site-request-forgery-csrf-"">Using Burp to Test for Cross-Site Request Forgery</a></li>\n    <li><a href=""https://media.blackhat.com/eu-13/briefings/Lundeen/bh-eu-13-deputies-still-confused-lundeen-wp.pdf"">The Deputies Are Still Confused</a></li>\n</ul>","<ul>\n<li><a href=""https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html"">CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</a></li>\n    <li><a href=""https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/62.html"">CAPEC-62: Cross Site Request Forgery</a></li>\n</ul>",The request appears to be vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks against authenticated users.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Typically, a user-supplied filename is appended to a directory prefix in order to read or write the contents of a file. If vulnerable, an attacker can supply path traversal sequences (using dot-dot-slash characters) to break out of the intended directory and read or write files elsewhere on the filesystem.</p>\n<p>This is typically a very serious vulnerability, enabling an attacker to access sensitive files containing configuration data, passwords, database records, log data, source code, and program scripts and binaries. </p>","<p>Ideally, application functionality should be designed in such a way that user-controllable data does not need to be passed to filesystem operations. This can normally be achieved by referencing known files via an index number rather than their name, and using application-generated filenames to save user-supplied file content.</p>\n<p>If it is considered unavoidable to pass user-controllable data to a filesystem operation, three layers of defense can be employed to prevent path traversal attacks: </p>\n<ul><li>User-controllable data should be strictly validated before being passed to any filesystem operation. In particular, input containing dot-dot sequences should be blocked.</li><li>After validating user input, the application can use a suitable filesystem API to verify that the file to be accessed is actually located within the base directory used by the application. In Java, this can be achieved by instantiating a java.io.File object using the user-supplied filename and then calling the getCanonicalPath method on this object. If the string returned by this method does not begin with the name of the start directory, then the user has somehow bypassed the application's input filters, and the request should be rejected. In ASP.NET, the same check can be performed by passing the user-supplied filename to the System.Io.Path.GetFullPath method and checking the returned string in the same way as described for Java.</li><li>The directory used to store files that are accessed using user-controllable data can be located on a separate logical volume to other sensitive application and operating system files, so that these cannot be reached via path traversal attacks. In Unix-based systems, this can be achieved using a chrooted filesystem; on Windows, this can be achieved by mounting the base directory as a new logical drive and using the associated drive letter to access its contents.</li></ul>","<ul>\n	<li><a href=""https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal"">Web Security Academy: Directory traversal</a></li>\n</ul>","<ul>\n<li><a href=""https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html"">CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')</a></li>\n<li><a href=""https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html"">CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal</a></li>\n<li><a href=""https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/35.html"">CWE-35: Path Traversal: '.../...//'</a></li>\n<li><a href=""https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/36.html"">CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal</a></li>\n	<li><a href=""https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/126.html"">CAPEC-126: Path Traversal</a></li>\n</ul>","The <b>page</b> parameter is vulnerable to path traversal attacks, enabling read access to arbitrary files on the server.<br><br>The payload <b>..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\windows\win.ini</b> was submitted in the page parameter.
