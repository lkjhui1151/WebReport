20007,,7.1,High,192.168.100.102,tcp,443,SSL Version 2 and 3 Protocol Detection,"The remote service encrypts traffic using a protocol with known
weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:
  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.
  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.
An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.
Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.
NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :
  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.
  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.
  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.
As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.
The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.
This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

exploit this, by sending a specially-crafted EFSRPC request, to cause the

One attack scenario, described within KB5005413, uses this exploit to initiate
an NTLM session as a domain controller's machine account. This session is then
relayed to an Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) host to obtain a

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :
  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.
  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.
  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.
If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

unresponsive.
There are several possible reasons for this :
  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop
    running.
  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.
This might be an availability problem related to the following :
  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.
  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.
  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

need to be done again.",#NAME?,,"Port 21 was detected as being open but is now closed

login (and therefore act as a local user on the remote host).
If an attacker gains a valid login and password, this service could be
used to gain further access on the remote host.  An attacker may also
use this service to mount a dictionary attack against the remote host
to try to log in remotely.
Note that RDP (the Remote Desktop Protocol) is vulnerable to
Man-in-the-middle attacks, making it easy for attackers to steal the
credentials of legitimate users by impersonating the Windows server.","Disable Terminal Services if you do not use it, and do not allow this

multiple vulnerabilities.","According to its banner, the version of PHP installed on the remote
host is prior to 5.2.7. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities :
  - There is a buffer overflow flaw in the bundled PCRE
    library that allows a denial of service attack.
    (CVE-2008-2371)
  - Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities exist in
    functions such as 'posix_access', 'chdir', and 'ftok'
    that allow a remote attacker to bypass 'safe_mode'
    restrictions. (CVE-2008-2665 and CVE-2008-2666).
  - A buffer overflow flaw in 'php_imap.c' may be triggered
    when processing long message headers due to the use of
    obsolete API calls. This can be exploited to cause a
    denial of service or to execute arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2008-2829)
  - A buffer overflow in the 'imageloadfont' function in
    'ext/gd/gd.c' can be triggered when a specially crafted
    font is given. This can be exploited to cause a denial
    of service or to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3658)

    'memnstr' which can be exploited by an attacker using
    the delimiter argument to the 'explode' function. This
    can be used to cause a denial of service or to execute
    arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3659)
  - When PHP is used as a FastCGI module, an attacker by
    requesting a file whose file name extension is preceded
    by multiple dots can cause a denial of service.
    (CVE-2008-3660)
  - A heap-based buffer overflow flaw in the mbstring
    extension can be triggered via a specially crafted
    string containing an HTML entity that is not handled
    during Unicode conversion. This can be exploited to
    execute arbitrary code.(CVE-2008-5557)
  - Improper initialization of global variables 'page_uid'
    and 'page_gid' when PHP is used as an Apache module
    allows the bypassing of security restriction due to
    SAPI 'php_getuid' function overloading. (CVE-2008-5624)
  - PHP does not enforce the correct restrictions when
    'safe_mode' is enabled through a 'php_admin_flag'
    setting in 'httpd.conf'. This allows an attacker, by
    placing a specially crafted 'php_value' entry in
    '.htaccess', to able to write to arbitrary files.
    (CVE-2008-5625)

    extension fails to filter directory traversal sequences
    from file names. An attacker can exploit this to write
    to arbitrary files. (CVE-2008-5658)
  - Under limited circumstances, an attacker can cause a
    file truncation to occur when calling the 'dba_replace'

  - A buffer overflow error exists in the function
    'date_from_ISO8601' function within file 'xmlrpc.c'

    restrictions. (CVE-2008-2665 and CVE-2008-2666).
  - A buffer overflow flaw in 'php_imap.c' may be triggered
    when processing long message headers due to the use of
    obsolete API calls. This can be exploited to cause a
    denial of service or to execute arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2008-2829)

    'ext/gd/gd.c' can be triggered when a specially crafted
    font is given. This can be exploited to cause a denial
    of service or to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3658)

vulnerabilities :
  - There is a buffer overflow flaw in the bundled PCRE
    library that allows a denial of service attack.
    (CVE-2008-2371)
  - Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities exist in
    functions such as 'posix_access', 'chdir', and 'ftok'
    that allow a remote attacker to bypass 'safe_mode'
    restrictions. (CVE-2008-2665 and CVE-2008-2666).
  - A buffer overflow flaw in 'php_imap.c' may be triggered
    when processing long message headers due to the use of
    obsolete API calls. This can be exploited to cause a
    denial of service or to execute arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2008-2829)
  - A buffer overflow in the 'imageloadfont' function in
    'ext/gd/gd.c' can be triggered when a specially crafted
    font is given. This can be exploited to cause a denial
    of service or to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3658)
  - A buffer overflow flaw exists in PHP's internal function
    'memnstr' which can be exploited by an attacker using
    the delimiter argument to the 'explode' function. This
    can be used to cause a denial of service or to execute
    arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3659)
  - When PHP is used as a FastCGI module, an attacker by
    requesting a file whose file name extension is preceded
    by multiple dots can cause a denial of service.
    (CVE-2008-3660)
  - A heap-based buffer overflow flaw in the mbstring
    extension can be triggered via a specially crafted
    string containing an HTML entity that is not handled
    during Unicode conversion. This can be exploited to
    execute arbitrary code.(CVE-2008-5557)
  - Improper initialization of global variables 'page_uid'
    and 'page_gid' when PHP is used as an Apache module
    allows the bypassing of security restriction due to
    SAPI 'php_getuid' function overloading. (CVE-2008-5624)
  - PHP does not enforce the correct restrictions when
    'safe_mode' is enabled through a 'php_admin_flag'
    setting in 'httpd.conf'. This allows an attacker, by
    placing a specially crafted 'php_value' entry in
    '.htaccess', to able to write to arbitrary files.
    (CVE-2008-5625)
  - The 'ZipArchive::extractTo' function in the ZipArchive
    extension fails to filter directory traversal sequences
    from file names. An attacker can exploit this to write

multiple vulnerabilities.","According to its banner, the version of PHP installed on the remote
host is prior to 5.2.7. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities :
  - There is a buffer overflow flaw in the bundled PCRE
    library that allows a denial of service attack.
    (CVE-2008-2371)
  - Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities exist in
    functions such as 'posix_access', 'chdir', and 'ftok'
    that allow a remote attacker to bypass 'safe_mode'
    restrictions. (CVE-2008-2665 and CVE-2008-2666).
  - A buffer overflow flaw in 'php_imap.c' may be triggered
    when processing long message headers due to the use of
    obsolete API calls. This can be exploited to cause a
    denial of service or to execute arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2008-2829)
  - A buffer overflow in the 'imageloadfont' function in
    'ext/gd/gd.c' can be triggered when a specially crafted
    font is given. This can be exploited to cause a denial
    of service or to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3658)
  - A buffer overflow flaw exists in PHP's internal function
    'memnstr' which can be exploited by an attacker using
    the delimiter argument to the 'explode' function. This
    can be used to cause a denial of service or to execute
    arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3659)
  - When PHP is used as a FastCGI module, an attacker by
    requesting a file whose file name extension is preceded
    by multiple dots can cause a denial of service.
    (CVE-2008-3660)
  - A heap-based buffer overflow flaw in the mbstring
    extension can be triggered via a specially crafted
    string containing an HTML entity that is not handled
    during Unicode conversion. This can be exploited to
    execute arbitrary code.(CVE-2008-5557)
  - Improper initialization of global variables 'page_uid'
    and 'page_gid' when PHP is used as an Apache module
    allows the bypassing of security restriction due to
    SAPI 'php_getuid' function overloading. (CVE-2008-5624)
  - PHP does not enforce the correct restrictions when
    'safe_mode' is enabled through a 'php_admin_flag'
    setting in 'httpd.conf'. This allows an attacker, by
    placing a specially crafted 'php_value' entry in
    '.htaccess', to able to write to arbitrary files.
    (CVE-2008-5625)
  - The 'ZipArchive::extractTo' function in the ZipArchive
    extension fails to filter directory traversal sequences
    from file names. An attacker can exploit this to write
    to arbitrary files. (CVE-2008-5658)
  - Under limited circumstances, an attacker can cause a
    file truncation to occur when calling the 'dba_replace'
    function with an invalid argument. (CVE-2008-7068)
  - A buffer overflow error exists in the function
    'date_from_ISO8601' function within file 'xmlrpc.c'

multiple vulnerabilities.","According to its banner, the version of PHP installed on the remote
host is prior to 5.2.7. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities :
  - There is a buffer overflow flaw in the bundled PCRE
    library that allows a denial of service attack.
    (CVE-2008-2371)
  - Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities exist in
    functions such as 'posix_access', 'chdir', and 'ftok'
    that allow a remote attacker to bypass 'safe_mode'
    restrictions. (CVE-2008-2665 and CVE-2008-2666).
  - A buffer overflow flaw in 'php_imap.c' may be triggered
    when processing long message headers due to the use of
    obsolete API calls. This can be exploited to cause a
    denial of service or to execute arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2008-2829)
  - A buffer overflow in the 'imageloadfont' function in
    'ext/gd/gd.c' can be triggered when a specially crafted
    font is given. This can be exploited to cause a denial
    of service or to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3658)
  - A buffer overflow flaw exists in PHP's internal function
    'memnstr' which can be exploited by an attacker using
    the delimiter argument to the 'explode' function. This
    can be used to cause a denial of service or to execute
    arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3659)
  - When PHP is used as a FastCGI module, an attacker by
    requesting a file whose file name extension is preceded
    by multiple dots can cause a denial of service.
    (CVE-2008-3660)
  - A heap-based buffer overflow flaw in the mbstring
    extension can be triggered via a specially crafted
    string containing an HTML entity that is not handled
    during Unicode conversion. This can be exploited to
    execute arbitrary code.(CVE-2008-5557)
  - Improper initialization of global variables 'page_uid'
    and 'page_gid' when PHP is used as an Apache module
    allows the bypassing of security restriction due to
    SAPI 'php_getuid' function overloading. (CVE-2008-5624)
  - PHP does not enforce the correct restrictions when
    'safe_mode' is enabled through a 'php_admin_flag'
    setting in 'httpd.conf'. This allows an attacker, by
    placing a specially crafted 'php_value' entry in
    '.htaccess', to able to write to arbitrary files.
    (CVE-2008-5625)
  - The 'ZipArchive::extractTo' function in the ZipArchive
    extension fails to filter directory traversal sequences
    from file names. An attacker can exploit this to write
    to arbitrary files. (CVE-2008-5658)
  - Under limited circumstances, an attacker can cause a
    file truncation to occur when calling the 'dba_replace'
    function with an invalid argument. (CVE-2008-7068)
  - A buffer overflow error exists in the function
    'date_from_ISO8601' function within file 'xmlrpc.c'

multiple vulnerabilities.","According to its banner, the version of PHP installed on the remote
host is prior to 5.2.7. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities :
  - There is a buffer overflow flaw in the bundled PCRE
    library that allows a denial of service attack.
    (CVE-2008-2371)
  - Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities exist in
    functions such as 'posix_access', 'chdir', and 'ftok'
    that allow a remote attacker to bypass 'safe_mode'
    restrictions. (CVE-2008-2665 and CVE-2008-2666).
  - A buffer overflow flaw in 'php_imap.c' may be triggered
    when processing long message headers due to the use of
    obsolete API calls. This can be exploited to cause a
    denial of service or to execute arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2008-2829)
  - A buffer overflow in the 'imageloadfont' function in
    'ext/gd/gd.c' can be triggered when a specially crafted
    font is given. This can be exploited to cause a denial
    of service or to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3658)
  - A buffer overflow flaw exists in PHP's internal function
    'memnstr' which can be exploited by an attacker using
    the delimiter argument to the 'explode' function. This
    can be used to cause a denial of service or to execute
    arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3659)
  - When PHP is used as a FastCGI module, an attacker by
    requesting a file whose file name extension is preceded
    by multiple dots can cause a denial of service.
    (CVE-2008-3660)
  - A heap-based buffer overflow flaw in the mbstring
    extension can be triggered via a specially crafted
    string containing an HTML entity that is not handled
    during Unicode conversion. This can be exploited to
    execute arbitrary code.(CVE-2008-5557)
  - Improper initialization of global variables 'page_uid'
    and 'page_gid' when PHP is used as an Apache module
    allows the bypassing of security restriction due to
    SAPI 'php_getuid' function overloading. (CVE-2008-5624)
  - PHP does not enforce the correct restrictions when
    'safe_mode' is enabled through a 'php_admin_flag'
    setting in 'httpd.conf'. This allows an attacker, by
    placing a specially crafted 'php_value' entry in
    '.htaccess', to able to write to arbitrary files.
    (CVE-2008-5625)
  - The 'ZipArchive::extractTo' function in the ZipArchive
    extension fails to filter directory traversal sequences
    from file names. An attacker can exploit this to write
    to arbitrary files. (CVE-2008-5658)
  - Under limited circumstances, an attacker can cause a
    file truncation to occur when calling the 'dba_replace'
    function with an invalid argument. (CVE-2008-7068)
  - A buffer overflow error exists in the function
    'date_from_ISO8601' function within file 'xmlrpc.c'
    because user-supplied input is improperly validated.
    This can be exploited by a remote attacker to cause a
    denial of service or to execute arbitrary code.

    as 'AllowOverride' and 'Options' in the configuration
    file, which could enable a local user to bypass
    security restrictions. (CVE-2009-1195)
  - Failure to properly handle an amount of streamed data
    that exceeds the Content-Length value allows a remote
    attacker to force a proxy process to consume CPU time
    indefinitely when mod_proxy is used in a reverse proxy
    configuration. (CVE-2009-1890)

    remote attacker to consume large amounts of CPU if
    there is a large (>10 MB) file available that has
    mod_deflate enabled. (CVE-2009-1891)
  - Using a specially crafted XML document with a large
    number of nested entities, a remote attacker may be
    able to consume an excessive amount of memory due to
    a flaw in the bundled expat XML parser used by the
    mod_dav and mod_dav_svn modules. (CVE-2009-1955)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the
    Anti-Replay feature in the DTLS implementation due to
    improper handling of epoch sequence numbers in records.
    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,
    via spoofed DTLS records, to cause legitimate packets to
    be dropped. (CVE-2016-2181)

    process, resulting in a denial of service.
    (CVE-2016-6302)
  - An integer overflow condition exists in the 
    MDC2_Update() function in mdc2dgst.c due to improper
    validation of user-supplied input. An unauthenticated,
    remote attacker can exploit this to cause a heap-based
    buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service
    condition or possibly the execution of arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2016-6303)

OpenSSL 1.0.1 prior to 1.0.1u. It is, therefore, affected by the
following vulnerabilities :

  - Multiple integer overflow conditions exist in s3_srvr.c,
    ssl_sess.c, and t1_lib.c due to improper use of pointer
    arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-2177)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the
    dsa_sign_setup() function in dsa_ossl.c due to a failure
    to properly ensure the use of constant-time operations.
    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,
    via a timing side-channel attack, to disclose DSA key
    information. (CVE-2016-2178)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the DTLS
    implementation due to a failure to properly restrict the
    lifetime of queue entries associated with unused
    out-of-order messages. An unauthenticated, remote
    attacker can exploit this, by maintaining multiple
    crafted DTLS sessions simultaneously, to exhaust memory.
    (CVE-2016-2179)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the X.509 Public
    Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP)
    implementation. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can
    exploit this, via a crafted time-stamp file that is
    mishandled by the 'openssl ts' command, to cause 
    denial of service or to disclose sensitive information.
    (CVE-2016-2180)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the
    Anti-Replay feature in the DTLS implementation due to
    improper handling of epoch sequence numbers in records.
    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,
    via spoofed DTLS records, to cause legitimate packets to
    be dropped. (CVE-2016-2181)

  - An overflow condition exists in the BN_bn2dec() function
    in bn_print.c due to improper validation of
    user-supplied input when handling BIGNUM values. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    crash the process. (CVE-2016-2182)

  - A vulnerability exists, known as SWEET32, in the 3DES
    and Blowfish algorithms due to the use of weak 64-bit
    block ciphers by default. A man-in-the-middle attacker
    who has sufficient resources can exploit this
    vulnerability, via a 'birthday' attack, to detect a
    collision that leaks the XOR between the fixed secret
    and a known plaintext, allowing the disclosure of the
    secret text, such as secure HTTPS cookies, and possibly
    resulting in the hijacking of an authenticated session.
    (CVE-2016-2183)

  - A flaw exists in the tls_decrypt_ticket() function in
    t1_lib.c due to improper handling of ticket HMAC
    digests. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit
    this, via a ticket that is too short, to crash the
    process, resulting in a denial of service.
    (CVE-2016-6302)

  - An integer overflow condition exists in the 
    MDC2_Update() function in mdc2dgst.c due to improper
    validation of user-supplied input. An unauthenticated,
    remote attacker can exploit this to cause a heap-based
    buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service
    condition or possibly the execution of arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2016-6303)

  - A flaw exists in the ssl_parse_clienthello_tlsext()
    function in t1_lib.c due to improper handling of overly
    large OCSP Status Request extensions from clients. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via
    large OCSP Status Request extensions, to exhaust memory
    resources, resulting in a denial of service condition.
    (CVE-2016-6304)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the certificate
    parser that allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker
    to cause a denial of service via crafted certificate
    operations. (CVE-2016-6306)

  - A flaw exists in the GOST ciphersuites due to the use of
    long-term keys to establish an encrypted connection. A
    man-in-the-middle attacker can exploit this, via a Key
    Compromise Impersonation (KCI) attack, to impersonate
    the server.","Upgrade to OpenSSL version 1.0.1u or later.

Note that the GOST ciphersuites vulnerability is not yet fixed by the
vendor in an official release; however, a patch for the issue has been
committed to the OpenSSL github repository.","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160922.txt

  - Multiple integer overflow conditions exist in s3_srvr.c,
    ssl_sess.c, and t1_lib.c due to improper use of pointer
    arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-2177)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the
    dsa_sign_setup() function in dsa_ossl.c due to a failure
    to properly ensure the use of constant-time operations.
    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,
    via a timing side-channel attack, to disclose DSA key
    information. (CVE-2016-2178)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the DTLS
    implementation due to a failure to properly restrict the
    lifetime of queue entries associated with unused
    out-of-order messages. An unauthenticated, remote
    attacker can exploit this, by maintaining multiple
    crafted DTLS sessions simultaneously, to exhaust memory.
    (CVE-2016-2179)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the X.509 Public
    Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP)
    implementation. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can
    exploit this, via a crafted time-stamp file that is
    mishandled by the 'openssl ts' command, to cause 
    denial of service or to disclose sensitive information.
    (CVE-2016-2180)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the
    Anti-Replay feature in the DTLS implementation due to
    improper handling of epoch sequence numbers in records.
    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,
    via spoofed DTLS records, to cause legitimate packets to
    be dropped. (CVE-2016-2181)

  - An overflow condition exists in the BN_bn2dec() function
    in bn_print.c due to improper validation of
    user-supplied input when handling BIGNUM values. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    crash the process. (CVE-2016-2182)

  - A vulnerability exists, known as SWEET32, in the 3DES
    and Blowfish algorithms due to the use of weak 64-bit
    block ciphers by default. A man-in-the-middle attacker
    who has sufficient resources can exploit this
    vulnerability, via a 'birthday' attack, to detect a
    collision that leaks the XOR between the fixed secret

    MDC2_Update() function in mdc2dgst.c due to improper
    validation of user-supplied input. An unauthenticated,
    remote attacker can exploit this to cause a heap-based
    buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service
    condition or possibly the execution of arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2016-6303)

  - A flaw exists in the ssl_parse_clienthello_tlsext()
    function in t1_lib.c due to improper handling of overly
    large OCSP Status Request extensions from clients. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via

    (CVE-2016-2183)

  - A flaw exists in the tls_decrypt_ticket() function in
    t1_lib.c due to improper handling of ticket HMAC
    digests. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit
    this, via a ticket that is too short, to crash the
    process, resulting in a denial of service.
    (CVE-2016-6302)

  - An integer overflow condition exists in the 
    MDC2_Update() function in mdc2dgst.c due to improper
    validation of user-supplied input. An unauthenticated,
    remote attacker can exploit this to cause a heap-based
    buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service
    condition or possibly the execution of arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2016-6303)

  - A flaw exists in the ssl_parse_clienthello_tlsext()
    function in t1_lib.c due to improper handling of overly
    large OCSP Status Request extensions from clients. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via
    large OCSP Status Request extensions, to exhaust memory
    resources, resulting in a denial of service condition.
    (CVE-2016-6304)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the certificate
    parser that allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker
    to cause a denial of service via crafted certificate
    operations. (CVE-2016-6306)

  - A flaw exists in the GOST ciphersuites due to the use of
    long-term keys to establish an encrypted connection. A
    man-in-the-middle attacker can exploit this, via a Key
    Compromise Impersonation (KCI) attack, to impersonate
    the server.","Upgrade to OpenSSL version 1.0.1u or later.

    attacker can exploit this to cause a denial of service
    condition. (CVE-2017-3169)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in mod_http2 that
    is triggered when handling a specially crafted HTTP/2
    request. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit
    this to cause a denial of service condition. Note that
    this vulnerability does not affect 2.2.x.
    (CVE-2017-7659)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the
    ap_find_token() function due to improper handling of
    header sequences. An unauthenticated, remote attacker

    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.
  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.
  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.
