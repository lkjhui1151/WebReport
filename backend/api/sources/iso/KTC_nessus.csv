  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial

need to be done again.","- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

however, no credentials were provided in the scan policy.","Nessus was not able to successfully authenticate directly to the
remote target on an available authentication protocol. Nessus was
able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service
running on the port supports an authentication protocol, but Nessus
failed to authenticate to the remote service using the provided
credentials. There may have been a protocol failure that prevented
authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials
for the authentication protocol may be invalid. See plugin output for
error details.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.","n/a","","SSH was detected on port 22 but no credentials were provided.

- Providing valid credentials for all available

Many frameworks and languages treat 'HEAD' as a 'GET' request, albeit
one without any body in the response. If a security constraint was
set on 'GET' requests such that only 'authenticatedUsers' could
access GET requests for a particular servlet or resource, it would be
bypassed for the 'HEAD' version. This allowed unauthorized blind
submission of any privileged GET request.

As this list may be incomplete, the plugin also tests - if 'Thorough

in the scan policy - various known HTTP methods on each directory and
considers them as unsupported if it receives a response code of 400,

using a weak hashing algorithm.","The remote service uses a known CA certificate in the SSL certificate
chain that has been signed using a cryptographically weak hashing
algorithm (e.g., MD2, MD4, MD5, or SHA1). These signature algorithms
are known to be vulnerable to collision attacks. An attacker can
exploit this to generate another certificate with the same digital
signature, allowing the attacker to masquerade as the affected
service.

Note that this plugin reports all SSL certificate chains signed with
SHA-1 that expire after January 1, 2017 as vulnerable. This is in
accordance with Google's gradual sunsetting of the SHA-1 cryptographic
hash algorithm.

Note that this plugin will only fire on root certificates that are known certificate authorities as listed in Tenable
Community Knowledge Article 000001752. That is what differentiates this plugin from plugin 35291, which will fire on
any certificate, not just known certificate authority root certificates.

Known certificate authority root certificates are inherently trusted and so any potential issues with the signature,
including it being signed using a weak hashing algorithm, are not considered security issues.","Contact the Certificate Authority to have the certificate reissued.","http://www.nessus.org/u?ae636e78
