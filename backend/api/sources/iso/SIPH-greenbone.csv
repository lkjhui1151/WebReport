  keys. The Arcfour cipher is believed to be compatible with the RC4 cipher [SCHNEIER]. Arcfour
  (and RC4) has problems with weak keys, and should not be used anymore.

  - The 'none' algorithm specifies that no encryption is to be done. Note that this method provides
  no confidentiality protection, and it is NOT RECOMMENDED to use it.

  - A vulnerability exists in SSH messages that employ CBC mode that may allow an attacker to
  recover plaintext from a block of ciphertext.","Checks the supported encryption algorithms (client-to-server
  and server-to-client) of the remote SSH server.

  Currently weak encryption algorithms are defined as the following:

  - Arcfour (RC4) cipher based algorithms

  - none algorithm

  - CBC mode cipher based algorithms

  - RC4 is considered to be weak (CVE-2013-2566, CVE-2015-2808)
  - Ciphers using 64 bit or less are considered to be vulnerable to brute force methods

  keys. The Arcfour cipher is believed to be compatible with the RC4 cipher [SCHNEIER]. Arcfour
  (and RC4) has problems with weak keys, and should not be used anymore.
  - The 'none' algorithm specifies that no encryption is to be done. Note that this method provides
  no confidentiality protection, and it is NOT RECOMMENDED to use it.

  recover plaintext from a block of ciphertext.","Checks the supported encryption algorithms (client-to-server

  - 1024 bit RSA authentication is considered to be insecure and therefore as weak
  - Any cipher considered to be secure for only the next 10 years is considered as medium
  - Any other cipher is considered as strong","
