obtain credentials or other sensitive information and to modify

The following HTTP methods are considered insecure:
  PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, TRACE, HEAD

Many frameworks and languages treat 'HEAD' as a 'GET' request, albeit
one without any body in the response. If a security constraint was
set on 'GET' requests such that only 'authenticatedUsers' could
access GET requests for a particular servlet or resource, it would be
bypassed for the 'HEAD' version. This allowed unauthorized blind
submission of any privileged GET request.

As this list may be incomplete, the plugin also tests - if 'Thorough
tests' are enabled or 'Enable web applications tests' is set to 'yes'
in the scan policy - various known HTTP methods on each directory and
considers them as unsupported if it receives a response code of 400,

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop
    running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

affects SMBv1 or another version. In response to this, US-CERT

these potential issues.","Disable SMBv1 according to the vendor instructions in Microsoft
