There may have been a protocol failure that prevented\nauthentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials\nfor the authentication protocol may be invalid. See plugin output for\nerror details.\n\nPlease note the following :\n\n- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for\n  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not\n  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH\n  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for\n  an available SNMP service.\n\n- Providing valid credentials for all available\n  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but\n  the value of successful authentication for a given\n  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon\n  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that\n  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH\n  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows\n  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB\n  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux\n  targets.",

Microsoft recommends that users discontinue the use\nof SMBv1 due to the lack of security features that were included in\nlater SMB versions. Additionally, the Shadow Brokers group reportedly\nhas an exploit that affects SMB; however, it is unknown if the exploit\naffects SMBv1 or another version. In response to this, US-CERT\nrecommends that users disable SMBv1 per SMB best practices to mitigate\nthese potential issues.",
